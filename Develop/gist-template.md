# Jide's Regex Tutorial

This gist will be covering a tutorial on regular expression and how it can be used to search for a url. 

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.
The regex expression that will be covered in this tutorial is `^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$`.
Regex can be interpreted from left to right. <br>

The opening symbol ^ indicates to start matching from the beginning of a string or line,
the first group enclosed in parentheses is optional because of the ? appended (https?:\/\/) will match http and optionally s, then a :, then //.<br>
The next group will be `([\da-z\.-]+)`, which will match one or more set of digits and small case letters a-z followed by a period and a dash. <br>
The next group will be `([a-z\.]{2,6})` which match small letter case aphabets from a-z followed by a period within the range of 2 to 6. <br>
`([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$` will match all forwards slahes followed by any word followed by any period, followed by any dash. <br>
The * after the closing parentheses will match 0 or more of the captured group followed optionally by an forwards slash and finally the dollar symbol to signify the end of the string or line.

## Regex Components
## Anchors
In this tutorial the ^ symbol is used. It matches the beginning of a string. It also matches the beginning of a new line if the multine flag is enabled.<br>
It is important to note that the ^ symbol matches a position and not a character. For example in the beginning of the regex `^(https?:\/\/)` it used to indicate beginning of the string<br>
<br>
The dollar sign matches the end of the string, or the end of a line line if the multiline flag is enabled. It is important to note that the `$` symbol matches a position and not a character. For example `([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$` is used to indicate the end of the string.

## Literal Characters
This represents literally the characters that are being matched. For example, in the first captured group `(https?:\/\/)`.<br>
 h is a literal character that will be matched, followed by t, followed by another t, followed by a p, followed by an s.<br>
 Regex will match https as these are the literal characters being searched for in the text.<br>
 Notice there is a ? after s, meaning matching the s is optional. This is a quantifier called an optional, and it'll be discussed in the Quantifiers section of the tutorial.<br>
 Then there's a : which is a literal colon.<br>
 The `\/\/` is an escaped character and will be discussed in more detail in the escaped character section of the tutorial.<br>

## Quantifiers
Quantifiers are used to indicate that the prepending chatacter is to matches a certain number of times.<br>
In this tutorial there are a bunch of different quantifiers being used.<br>

The ? optional quantifier which was briefly introduced in the preceeding section indicates that the preceeding character is optional. <br>
For example `(https?:\/\/)` indicates that the match can return text that has an s or not. Therefore, all matches of http and https will be returned.<br>

The + matches one or more of the prepending character.<br>
For example `([\da-z\.-]+)` will match one of more of the captured group of digits from 0-9, followed by small case alphabets from a-z, followed by a period and a -. <br>

The {2,6} matches the specified quantity of the prepending character. {2,6} will match 2 to 6. {2} will match only 2.<br>
For example in the group `([a-z\.]{2,6})`, only character sets between 2 and 6 will be matched.<br>

The * matches 0 or more of the prepending character.<br>
For example in the captured group `([\/\w \.-]*)*` will match one of more of the captured group<br>

## Escaped Characters
This is used to insert reserved, special and unicode characters. To use an escaped character a \ must be prepended to the character.<br>
In the first captured group `(https?:\/\/)` the `\/`  will match a forward slash /. `\/\/` will match two forward slashes //.<br>
Another example is the `([\da-z\.-]+)` group. `\.` this is an escaped character that uses the \ prepended to the . character to find a match.<br>

## Grouping and Capturing
When a group of characters are enclosed in parentheses, this is refered to as grouping and capturing.v
This enables substrings to be extracted.<br>
In this tutorial there are 4 capturing groups.<br>
`(https?:\/\/)` - Here the group captured is https:// with the s being optional so http:// will also be matched.<br>
`([\da-z\.-]+)`<br>
`([a-z\.]{2,6})`<br>
`([\/\w \.-]*)`<br>

## Character Classes
Character classes match a characters from a specific set. Example of  character classes are character set, negated set, range, dot, match any, word, not word, digit, not digit.<br>
In this tutorial character set will be discussed in detail.<br>

Character set matches any character enclosed in square brackets [].<br>
There are three character sets in the regular expression. 
`[\da-z\.-]`, `[a-z\.]` and  `[\/\w \.-]`<br>

`[\da-z\.-]` - In this character set there are two character classes digit and range.<br>
digit - `\d` will match any digit character from 0-9 <br>
range - `a-z` will mtach characters in the a-z range. It is case sensitive. <br>

`[a-z\.]` - In this character set there is a range character class and an escaped character. <br>

`[\/\w \.-]`- In this character set there is a escaped character \/ which will match a forward slash /, there is a character class \w, followed by an escaped character \., followed by a literal - character.<br>
word - `\w` will match any word character both alphanumeric and underscore. So a-z, A-Z, and 0-9. <br>
